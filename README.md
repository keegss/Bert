# Bert the Bot 

The main purpose of this project was to create a robot platform for future testing/projects with openCV and ROS.

The platform was built using a Raspberry Pi 3, webcam, 2 DC Motors, a DROK Motor Controller, a Voltage Converter, a 12V battery pack, and some duck tape.

To test the functionality of the the platform I ran a python script (teleop.py) that allowed for control of the robot with a keyboard as well as a line following script (lineFollowing.py).
